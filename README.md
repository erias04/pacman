# pacman

## Idea:
It all started with a search in the app store of 'pacman' on my TV. I wanted to play pacman on my LG Smart TV (Powered by WebOS) and went into the app store and searched for pacman. There were a couple of other games already developed so I thought that there has to be a pacman game. I said to myself 'if there is no pacman game onto my TV, I will code it myself.' And so I submitted the 'pacman' search and it said 'Sorry, there is no 'pacman' game'. In that moment I realized I have to develope a pacman game for WebOS by myself.
