# pacman

## Idea
It all started with a search in the App Store in my TV. I wanted to play pacman with the LG Smart TV (which is powered by WebOS) and went into the app store and searched for pacman. There were a couple of other games already developed so I thought that there has to be a pacman game. I said myself: 'If there is no pacman game avaliable, I will code it myself.' With that I hit enter to the 'pacman' search and it said 'Sorry, there is no 'pacman' game'. In that moment I realized I have to develope a pacman game for WebOS.
